           For these photographs, initially annoyed by the short timeframe to get used to the mechanics of a DSLR, and being forced to photo exclusively within the walls of Hunter College, I decided to try to focus on alien abstractions within the limitations. Things, that when pulled out of context, wouldn’t seem part of the environment they were in. These images look like something from a space of industrialization like a factory or a warehouse, not something sitting in a college hallway. Much of what I want to explore through my degree is the relationship between human and what feels like an almost anti-human entity which we are being enveloped in through increasing technolization. Compositionally, outside of forcing the abstraction I tried to erase as much of what could be identified beyond that abstraction. Force one to go play ‘I spy’ to identify what or where this even is. The first photo, the machinery entirely envelopes the image and the second, in contrast, leaves the control panel isolated against a brick wall. I used simple hue/ saturation/ contrast to push further the alien-ness off the images and to pull the metal machinery in the external into machinery of the circuitboards, screens, and the digital and then, clearly, onto GitHub which subsumes it into the cloud space, the exo-space, if you will. The space of current and forth-coming rupture.
