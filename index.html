      <h2> Statement: </h2>
      <p>
        I don't have a statement at the moment...
        <br>
        Stay Alive?
        <br>
        Don't let my heart kill me.
        <br>
        Don't entirely jelly the spine I'd grown in my youth.
        <br>
        Try to discover a will to create again in the face of world that would be happy to grind me into pink paste.
        <br>
        Keep learning, keep engaging, keep maintining opposition, keep considering the humanity in the stories of others.
        <br>
        Never ever belly up to power players.
        <br>
        Never say that a politics built out of disintegrating the lived experience of every person,
        <br>
        built out of systematizing away the things that make life absolutely alive,
        <br>
        that makes emotions expressed, expressive, and informative,
        <br>
        is in any way what-so-fucking-ever an acceptable type of politics.
        <br>
        So ... yea, I guess that was summed up in the first line.
