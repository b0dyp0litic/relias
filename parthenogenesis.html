          The term parthenogenesis is the scientific term for conception without fertilization. The venture capitalist class that believe they have the capacity to bridle the leviathan of techno-capital and harness it toward their end, as if it cares at all about them, tend to all fall in-line with a singular idea of the future, flirted with in the LessWrong forum thought-experiment known as Roko’s Basilisk, that capital is an external force that bends the tide of history toward its own realization and that that is an indication of a being of divinity. They believe that the way toward eternity, toward an evolution beyond the human meatbag is to push everything into Artificial Intelligence, that this was and is divine determinism, that this will inevitably birth the post-human, and that the lucky few will somehow get to port their consciousness into this new external entity and experience what could only be described as something like a state of nirvana. It isn’t an accident that the world of the elite is starting to absorb aspects of Catholicism, that Peter Thiel rants about the anti-christ and that JD Vance is trying to score points with the pope. They believe they are the ones building the architecture in which God becomes its next iteration, arguably a form of immaculate conception. The problem is that there is no incentive for them to consider whether this is absolutely absurd or not. There appear to be no brakes on this train. We are all fodder for this process whether that end can and should be realized or not.
