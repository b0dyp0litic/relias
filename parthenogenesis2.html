          This piece is built out images of major data centers, Google, Oracle, Microsoft, as well as an image from the OISHII fruit company’s vertical strawberry experimentation farm. I also used religious iconography, random images of wires, a pregnant woman, and the halo formed around the sun when it is behind clouds. All images were pulled from Bing’s Creative Commons search. I don’t think I have or would ever use this product otherwise but it worked great for this piece. The screenshot shown here shows about 1/3 of the layers I used in editing. There are a number of techniques, some non-destructive:  images with dedicated adjustment layers, pieces of images copied into new layers, etc., and some total dissections of images, like the halos and wires. I worked for years for a division of Amazon launching publishers digitally that were predominantly graphic based, 99.99% of my publisher launches were comic-books. I am not a comic person but I did slightly take influence for this from an arguably lame movement that came about in the late nineties and early 2000s that used photo-montage and rotoscoping and things to incorporate external images into comic frames. They may not have intended it to be actively cheesy but I intentionally leaned into that here.
