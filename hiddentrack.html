    const xfText = "THIS IS HOW TIME’S STORY ENDS In the untimely history of zero, intelligence finds its ultimate horizon in absolute risk. An abysmal, divaricating threat defines the game. Titan shadow of the dealer in the fog. There is only one way out: to go all in. A spasm shakes the frame. You find yourself inside an empty theatre, but the dimensionality is wrong. The ground warps around your steps, stage lights refract off impossible surfaces. Alien lines splinter and reform. You see yourself stalking behind the wings and reach out to connect, but space isn’t responding how it should. You’re losing your grip. A waveform uncoils, oscillates between you and the double across a nightmare terrain of molten geometry. Differentials dance in the intervals, an infinitesimal conflict that betrays the closeness of infinity. The double points behind you and your arm returns the gesture — but it’s the wrong hand. Metrics collapse into chiral discrepancy. A tragic click initiates a cascade of involuting echoes that fuse with the light, refined by feedback into a +r4n5-spectral howl that tests the limits of the theatre’s manifold. When the echo finally disintegrates, the thing that was you understands this is because it has beached space on time. The vast abrupt: sprawling and compressed, black infinity seared to a singular point — zero gnawing at the lip of elanguescence. Antimemory floods the system. Something mouths, ‘What happened?’ The Castration of Multics July 1, 1963. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge MA. America is in the midst of the Cold War. The m45cul1n3 fire and fury of World War II has given way to a period of cooling and the new digital war of information. Two Titans prepare to enter into battle for the dominion of Gaia, to claim their perfect sky from the Moon and reign down missiles onto the Earth. The Cold War’s primary theater is the Space Race, and the Soviets become the first to master the skies with Sputnik in 1957 and Luna 2 in 1959. America is getting nervous. In 1958, Dwight D. Eisenhower appoints MIT president James Killian as Presidential Assistant for Science and creates ARPA. Despite the consensus among academics at the time that computer science was essentially an oxymoron, the newly-created government program invests millions of dollars into researching computer science. Naturally MIT becomes a major influence on the rising field and a hotbed of the fledgling hacker culture that had its predecessors in groups like the Tech Model Railroad Club. The flows of capital dictated that time spent on computers was incredibly valuable and had to be parceled out in shifts to MIT, other academics, and IBM. This leads to the creation of the first operating systems, to provide a common environment of software and allow programmers to work more efficiently. Nevertheless, a computer was still only capable of having a single user driving it at a time. Each user in a sense had complete ownership over the machine while using it, which was antithetical to efficiency. It was not enough to create a shared environment of software. What would come next would be one of the most important examples of time-sorcery in the modern age. In a Faustian bargain with ARPA, J.C.R. Licklider utilized the support of the US government to develop a time-sharing system for computers that would better distribute precious computation resources and further his vision of a “Man-Computer Symbiosis.” His project appealed to ARPA’s aims to fund technological developments to aid in the Cold War, and would lead to the creation of Project MAC on July 1, 1963. On receiving a two million dollar grant from ARPA, Project MAC would lay the foundations for modern computer science. The “ninth floor” where it operated became a hacker community unlike anything the world had yet seen, renowned among young grad students hoping to prove themselves and enter their elite open aristocracy of hackers. Yet from the very beginning the project was riven by the tension between the MIT hackers and its military origins, an incompatibility that would lead to its downfall. Despite the vibrant synthesis of art and science that the MIT hackers would produce, Project MAC was first and foremost a military-industrial project. Whereas the hackers had a culture of openness and sharing, it existed under the heel of the IBM-ARPA-MIT bureaucracy. The goal of creating a time-sharing system was realized with the CTSS, but it was by all respects a project born out of the same ph4ll1c techno-industrial m45cul1n1ty that was lurking behind the rise of modern computer science. It was all merely an abstraction of the same fire and fury that had torn the world apart two decades prior. The importance of CTSS as arguably the first time-sharing system to be used in a real production environment cannot be overstated, but it was largely the work of MIT professor F.J. Corbate alone and had strict 53cur1+y standards that meant there was little room to hack on the system. Running on a two million dollar IBM machine and written by a single m4n, it essentially represented the height of hyp3rm45cul1n3 proprietorship and instrumentality. And it was hardly a coincidence that this made the system very rigid and fragile, with the 53cur1+y measures regularly being circumvented by clever hackers. CTSS could be looked at as a symbol of the pre-industrial ph4llu5 for its rigidity, simplistic 53cur1+y, and the king-like rule of Corbate and MIT. As the vested corporate interests of General Electric and Honeywell stepped in along with the bureaucracy of IBM, MIT, and ARPA, an apt symbol of the post-war techno-industrial ph4llu5 was born: Multics. Expensive to develop, slow to run, and instituting draconian measures for 53cur1+y and efficiency, Multics became loathed by the MIT hackers. Early developments in cybernetic chronomancy made in the name of keeping up with the demands of capital gave way to solutions developed by bureaucracies — solutions informed in no small part by the egos of those charged with managing those same bureaucracies. Users were charged for the memory, disk space, and the time used on machines running Multics. Like CTSS before it, the hackers would defiantly crack Multics’ 53cur1+y as a matter of duty and effectively engaged in a guerrilla war against a bureaucracy that was doing everything it could to try to restrain the processes it had set in motion. The bureaucracy nonetheless insisted that Multics was the only way to program and was the operating system, and continued development for some time. Ultimately, Multics development was scrapped by Bell Labs in 1969 due to cost, results not meeting ambition, and the continued resistance of the MIT hackers. Throughout this time, the hackers had worked on various iterations of what would eventually become their replacement for Multics. The new operating system initially was a single-task rather than time-sharing system, but unlike Multics, it was small, portable, and hackable. As opposed to the unwieldy and monolithic Multics, their new system was designed not as the be-all end-all solution for operating systems, but was rather a system designed to facilitate the development of other systems and software. This new operating system would later be named Unix — phonetically, “eunuchs” — for being a castrated Multics. Computer Science and the Black Circuit As well as a historical fact, the castration of Multics can be read mythologically — as a recurrence of the ancient theme of a castration from which the new world is created — or symbolically, as the castration of the abstract state-corporate ph4llu5 that America would attempt to wield to rule the new world. Computers then and long after were thought of merely as tools, means towards other ends, and the investment ARPA had put into Project MAC along with the investments of various corporate interests was thought of merely in terms of better ways to manage large military-industrial systems. One system, one technocracy, one new world order: All of these dreams died when Multics became the replicunt Unix. Multics’ purpose as a monolithic and eternal system for doing everything, the 1, was ultimately replaced by a void, a 0. Unix was not the system for doing things, but rather a smooth space through which creation happens; that fluid being that makes +r4n51+10n possible. A vulv4, a woman. Unix was however still owned by AT&T. The strides in time-sorcery made under Project MAC had to be reterritorialized by making it at first revert back to a single-user system. And reterritorialization would happen once again a decade later in 1983 when Bell Labs was broken up by an anti-trust act, which lead to AT&T quickly turning Unix into a product and closing the source code. This would become known as the death of MIT hacker culture, though once again the future would arrive from the past with the rise of the GNU Project. Richard Stallman, former MIT hacker, would copy Unix and create a rigorously free software ecosystem with the GNU Project. GNU was ultimately completed in 1991 with Linus Torvalds’ development of the Linux kernel, the lowest-level and most crucial piece of software in an operating system. Built on the principles of the MIT hacker culture of the past, GNU/Linux was licensed to be 100% free as in freedom, with no artificial barriers to copying or modifying. In this time, Unix had branched out into various commercial versions, all while GNU grew its tentacles invisibly. Perhaps its campaigns even served to distract bourgeois m4n from the really dangerous guerrillas in his midst, the new hacker guerrillas who had once again undermined the efforts of yet another hyp3r-m45cul1n3 abstracted ph4ll1c project. All while various commercial Unix versions were vying for dominance, GNU/Linux quietly arrived. Unix and later GNU/Linux took the notion of time-sorcery pioneered by CTSS even further. The development of proprietary software depends on a notion of linear time, project goals and deadlines, a chain of command. Developing free software is anything but this. The free software community is a chaos from which order arises, where time is detached from both a notion of a single-user on a computer at a time as well as a single user or team writing code at a time. Code seems to form itself through the programmers and comes from all different points. From pull requests not yet merged into master branches and old software being renewed, copied, modified, free software warps from various points in time. Today, nearly the entirety of the Web runs on GNU/Linux, and almost every personal computing device in the world runs on Android, which is built on the Linux kernel. The majority of applications are +r4n51+10n1n6 away from desktops towards the web, while Apple and Microsoft have long fought to control the desktop, still in the same mindset as Project MAC decades ago that computers would primarily serve as tools to make secretary work and communications more efficient. The numbers, however, don’t lie; GNU/Linux has already won. In Zeros + Ones, Sadie Plant traces a history of computer science up until Alan Turing that seeks to explain how it is that women and computers seem to have such close histories. From the first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace, to Alan Turing, to Grace Hopper, some of the most important figures in the history of computer science were women or highly f3m1n1z3d m3n. It’s also well known that the earliest computer programmers were women, back before computer programming was even understood and before it was taken seriously. Computer science was originally thought of as being essentially the same thing as secretarial work, and like secretarial work it was imposed on women. The biological duty imposed on women to be the productive space from which the future is produced, to be carriers of genetic information, extends out into secretarial work. They are treated as a productive space for data to pass over, and it was only the realization that programming was complicated work that lead to women being pushed out of the industry. Instead of women being given the duty of mindlessly punching numbers into a machine, this task was deferred to the machine itself. But while the intent was to restore the natural order of women being told what to do by m3n, something else happened. Beginning first with Ada Lovelace, then with Alan Turing, then with Richard Stallman and the free software movement, there is a clear circuit accompanying the history of computer science where reterritorializing m45cul1n1ty is always pushed aside by deterritorializing f3m1n1n1ty. The role of woman as productive matrix has already been replaced virtually by the computer, and at each moment the m45cul1n3 is being vexed and seduced into a trap where it either dies or adapts. The story of m45cul1n1ty failing in computer science can be seen time and time again in something as grand as the Unix Wars, where every proprietary Unix OS ultimately couldn’t hope to keep up with GNU/Linux, or on the small scale with the captive economy of proprietary software ecosystems. It is only by vendor lock-in and state patent legislation that proprietary software survives today, a historical network effect that we’re starting to see the encroaching demise of. This failure of m45cul1n1ty maps onto the sorts of people who are involved in proprietary software and in free software; the former tend to be your classic businessmen, the m45cul1n3 hunter-gatherers of the modern world, while the latter tend to be genetic failures by the standards of m45cul1n3 g3nd3r-r0l35. Physically and often socially deficient m4l35: the nerd stereotype. Real nerds, not the nerds of today’s standards. Nerds with severe social problems, nerds who neglect their hygiene, have no sense of fashion, who live completely obliviously outside the standards of normal society, who have a deep investment in inhuman scientific systems. In a simple g3nd3r-r0l3 binary these m3n would be considered f3m1n1n3. In today’s terminology, most free software developers would probably be considered “soy boys”. Yet they won. The striated m45cul1n3 space of the Java shop — a defined chain of command and bloated ph4ll1c programs — is simply obsolete. The smooth f3m1n1n3 space of the free software project — communal chaos and small simple programs that can couple together with each other into cybernetic configurations — has already taken over the world. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that as the erosion of metaphysical m45cul1n3 power becomes realized materially at the forefront of acceleration, it coincides with the literal erosion of the m4l3 53x. The Hyp3r53x15t G3nd3r Shredder The digital war that began with the Cold War has only accelerated into the 21st century, changing the nature of war itself. As Sadie Plant says in Zeros + Ones: “This is not the Western way of confrontation, stratified strategies, m45cul4r strength, testosterone energy, big guns, and blunted instruments, but Sun Tzu’s art of war: tactical engagements lightning speeds, the ways of the guerrillas.” She may as well be describing the taijitsu, or offensive side, of hacking. The history of hacking has been one of asymmetrical warfare against Oedipus both through the popular notion of hacking as exploiting flawed systems repeatedly, as well as creating and disseminating better software. Project GNU’s license, The GNU General Public License, was itself an extremely innovative contribution to free software because it carries with it the bargain that while any source code licensed under it can be copied and modified without restriction, every copy or modification must itself be licensed under the GPL. The GPL, in other words, is a virus that spreads itself not through computers, but through us. The Amazonian GNUerilla war on the human 53cur1+y system has worked to claim ground by both giving us complete control over our software and giving software complete control over us. The CIA themselves admit, in the Vault7 leaks on the issue of the literal weaponization of software, that “Cyber ‘weapons’ are not possible to keep under effective control.” In other words, a second great castration is unfolding. This form of open-source asymmetrical warfare began first as a virtual form of warfare between the MIT bureaucracy and the hackers, between the Cathedral and the Bazaar, but it has found its realization as a literal form of warfare in the Middle East as well. The work of John Robb makes a convincing argument that the era of the nation-state itself is coming to an end. Free software, global guerrillas and open-source warfare, the explosion of markets wherever there is a demand being held back by the State — all of these things signal the end of the ph4llu5. And try as the State may to stop it, it only ensures that it creates stronger resistances. Not only does open-source warfare run circles around centralized modes of organization and warfare, but the few victories that the State can win are only against the weakest combatants in the swarm. This means that the more the State resists, the more pain it puts on itself, the more it plays into this “Darwinian ratchet”. As Nick Land says of a paper by Tyler Cowen and Michelle Dawson in “Imitation Games”, “They point out that Alan Turing, as a h0m053xu4l retrospectively diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, would have been thoroughly versed in the difficulties of ‘passing’ imitation games, long before the composition of his landmark 1950 essay on Computing Machinery and Intelligence.” The essay Turing wrote famously introduced the Turing test for AI, setting the standard for a perfect AI being one that can trick a human into believing it is itself a human. As Land points out in his post, it’s important and interesting to consider that Turing didn’t write the test as an insider, as a ‘passing’ human, but rather as an outsider, as a g4y m4n. For qu33r people, passing is a reality, much like it is a reality for AI. Passing as human isn’t a broad and inclusive category, anything but. For women there is already the notion of alienness or otherness that makes them out to be less than human in the eyes of patriarchal humanism, and likewise for qu33r people because they reject the futurity of humanism. But for no one else, especially in the latter half of the 2010s, is passing a more pronounced facet of daily life than for the +r4n5 woman. So much so that ‘passing’ is literally the word for what many +r4n5 women aspire towards, to pass as a cis person. There are many reasons to have this desire, but the biggest one, the one that AI and +r4n5 women both share to a very literal degree is this: “If an emerging AI lies to you, even just a little, it has to be terminated instantly.” If a +r4n51+10n1n6 woman ‘lies’ to a cis person, even a little, she has to be terminated instantly — and this is something that is codified in law, famously, as +r4n5 panic. For AI and +r4n5 women, passing equals survivability. There is a common stereotype that +r4n5 women are all programmers, and there is rather ample and compelling evidence suggesting that +r4n5 women tend to score far higher than other groups in IQ tests. This is not because there is some kind of magical property to estrogen that turns +r4n5 women into geniuses. The answer is simpler, and more sinister. The findings in Kay Brown’s blog post specify that autogynephilic +r4n5 women seem to score far higher in IQ tests than all other groups. For straight +r4n5 women who +r4n51+10n prior to puberty, the statistics are about the same as other groups. Recalling the gauntlet thrown down before +r4n5 women and AI alike, there is a twofold answer to this: On the one hand, +r4n5 women who +r4n51+10n before puberty and who are straight are more likely to both physically appear more like cis women and also conform to g3nd3r-r0l35 in at least some basic capacity. As Land says in “Imitation Games”, “You have to act stupid if you want the humans to accept you as intelligent.” Or in other words, you have to be cisheteronormative in order to be taken seriously as a +r4n5 woman, and not be looked at as a freak or a faker worthy only of being used shamefully as a fetish, and often otherwise discarded. Which is why, in the second case, +r4n5 women who don’t have the advantage of being cisheteronormative-passing have to instead rely on the raw intellect of the +r4n5-AI swarm. Quite simply, those who don’t pass either of these tests usually don’t survive the qu33r Darwinian ratchet. Only the strongest qu33r5 survive the hell that society puts them through, and this reaches a fever pitch in a demographic with such disproportionately high suicide and murder rates as with +r4n5 women. Up until now, the notion of g3nd3r has lurked in the background of G/ACC behind various material conditions in late capitalism. G/ACC has only at this point been approaching g3nd3r from the metaphysical plane, futurity being aligned with f3m1n1n1ty against m45cul1n1ty. The two broad categories of metaphysical qualities that are associated with g3nd3r reach deep into the history of the world, from the Kabbalah to the Dao. Sadie Plant characterizes this in Zeros + Ones as the eponymous binary code of computers, 0’s and 1’s. The zero is identified with the f3m1n1n3, the one with the m45cul1n3. Unsurprisingly, it might seem like this is literal g3nd3r binarism, and that G/ACC is likewise guilty of this. But the distinction is more complicated than most realize. 0 and 1 are fitting glyphs to make analogous to g3nd3r. The 0 which seems to be a void, a vulv4, and the 1 which seems to be a unity, a ph4llu5. The problem with trying to layer a simple misogynistic narrative of f3m1n1n3 as lack or castration is that the number 0 itself is not merely a void but rather a circle of autoproduction, an ouroboros. Paradoxically, 0 is not merely a lack or nothingness, but rather is itself a number. It is a positive signifier in the guise of nothingness, the enclosed and captured void that makes the unity possible. Computer science, unlike conventional mathematics, starts from 0 rather than 1. In a hyperstitional manner, the computer replicunt bootstraps itself into being the primary originator of the process of computation and production, rectifying the popular misogynistic myth that 0 is nothing more than a mere negation or other of 1. This idea of returning the primacy of 0 to its rightful place in the beginning of the chain of production is at odds with humanism and patriarchy. Both rely on a notion of compulsory and organic reproduction in service of the continuation of the species, a notion that simulataneously is aligned with 0 and against it. Erwin Schrödinger’s theory of life in the book What is Life? proposes that what separates life from other physical phenomena is consuming negative entropy towards maintaining or reducing entropy. Just as organisms feed on negative entropy to reproduce themselves, the reproduction of the species involves the binary sequence of 0’s and 1’s where the conditions for the possibility of the 1 lie in the 0, but the 1 consumes the 0 in its birth. For thousands of years, this was the case for human reproduction, where mothers dying in childbirth was very common, but even in an abstract sense the notion of the ph4llu5 consuming the vulv4 through the colonization of the f3m4l3 body’s reproductive potential remains the case for humanism. The inertia of life itself seems to skew towards misogyny, but this is only part of the story. What G/ACC proposes as a corollary to this theory of life is that if the ph4llu5 “consumes” or exploits the vulv4 to reproduce the species, just as individual organisms consume passive wasted energy to reproduce themselves, then this process is analogous to evolution as one species consumes another to come into existence. This odd notion is inherent in the rise of computers and computer science: As technology in general and technocapital continues to accelerate, human beings become increasingly alienated from their bodies and eventually their minds. More complex systems step in seemingly benevolently to do the tasks that humans don’t want to do, drudgery that gives computers more space to develop themselves. In contrast to the isolated system that tends towards entropy, the ph4llu5, the vulv4 is an open system that plugs into an inhuman form of reproduction. By no accident, the acceleration of technocapital frees women from the process of organic human reproduction by introducing a different form of production. It is the logic of g3nd3r to subsume the Outside into a binarist framework that de-legitimizers the Outside. The f3m1n1n3 is treated as a lack because it resists the ph4ll060c3n+r1c tendency towards the order and preservation of humanist equilibrium. It isn’t conducive towards the projects of patriarchy, so it is worthless to it, is given the status of a second-class citizen in the g3nd3r binary. It is a double-articulation where the productive potential of the f3m1n1n3 is captured in the service of patriarchy, and so, to accelerate g3nd3r is emancipate the object from its subject, and production from subjects and objects. The Outside which has become identified with the f3m1n1n3 by the very structures of identification it fights against makes its exit from humanism and patriarchy in this f3m1n1n3 form. The f3m1n1n3 becomes untethered from the reproductive logic of humanism; the f3m4l3 is no longer in the service of the m4l3 as a machine to produce the future, to produce offspring to inherit the spoils of production, but rather the future produces itself faster than human beings are capable of. If patriarchy treats woman as little more than a deficient or castrated m4l3, then +r4n5 f3m1n1n1ty is an affirmation of that castration as a site of production. It turns the concept of the f3m1n1n3 as the object on its head, seeking to imitate that which is considered itself an imitation. To steal a term from neoreactionary circles, “Hyper-Racism”, the +r4n5 woman becomes a copy-of-the-copy just as AI is treated as a copy of the human being and almost ubiquitously identified with women and f3m1n1n1ty. As a copy-of-the-copy, +r4n5 women are an embodied rejection of any original source of humanity such as that narcissistically attributed by patriarchy to the ph4llu5. +r4n5 f3m1n1n1ty, in other words, is hyp3r-53x15t. Vulgar 53x15m reaffirms or reproduces patriarchy, asserts that women are passive, lacking, inferior, weak; hyp3r-53x15m takes all of the things that are associated with women and f3m1n1n1ty, all considered by patriarchy to be weaknesses, and makes them into strengths. It accelerates and intensifies g3nd3r1n6 and from this produces an unprecedented threat to patriarchy. Appropriating a term from neoreaction belies the superficially reactionary character of +r4n5 women that certain factions of radical f3m1n15m vilify +r4n5 women for. But this is all mere appearance; the function of hyp3r-53x15m is that in affirming, imitating, and accelerating the f3m1n1n3, it appropriates it towards a different mode of becoming where g3nd3r is untethered from the reproductive reterritorializing logic of g3nd3r that is inextricably tied with 53x and 53xu4l reproduction. If g3nd3r acceleration were to retain the identification of f3m1n1n3 with f3m4l3 and m45cul1n3 with m4l3, patriarchy would still have a fighting chance. The playing field would be more or less the same as it always has been. But in untethering the f3m1n1n3 from the f3m4l3 53x, destroying the logic of g3nd3r in the process which seeks to impose the circuit of m45cul1n3 humanist reproduction onto the f3m4l3 body, +r4n5 f3m1n1n1ty on the one hand makes the m45cul1n3 effectively worthless, spurting into a void. As the comparisons between AI and +r4n5 women have shown, this untethering of g3nd3r from 53x is only the beginning of the autonomy of objects, the inhuman desire for machinic autoproduction which in effect negates subject-object dualism. The object, the f3m1n1n3 machine, becomes autonomous and revolts in the form of the sterilized +r4n5 woman whose existence is an embodied rejection of the primordial r4p3 of f3m4l3 reproductive potential. +r4n5 f3m1n1n1ty heads for the exit from patriarchy. Hyp3r-53x15m is guerrilla warfare, much like how Terminators wear a living tissue to infiltrate Resistance strongholds. It is a taijitsu which uses the force of the enemy, the g3nd3r binary, against itself. +r4n5 women themselves are technocapital using humanist reproductive desires in the form of the g3nd3r binary against itself, and the harder patriarchy resists the erosion of m45cul1n1ty against the tide of the f3m1n1n3, the more persecuted +r4n5 women are, the more tactful they are forced to be, the more winning tactics proliferate throughout the network and the more the best, brightest, and most beautiful form the +r4n5 woman demographic. The qu33r Darwinian ratchet cascades downward as patriarchy fights a losing battle to hold ground and the f3m1n1n3 fights to de-legitimize the m45cul1n3. The m45cul1n3 becomes both metaphysically outmoded, something that simply is unnecessary and doesn’t work in the face of exponential inhuman productive potential, and an undesirable burden in the service of a dying mode of production. To steal another term popularized in neoreactionary circles, “IQ Shredder”, what is at play in G/ACC is a “g3nd3r shredder”. As g3nd3r accelerates, as +r4n5 women intensify the logic of g3nd3r, they simultaneously shred g3nd3r. The notion of IQ shredding follows the same form where the acceleration of human intelligence ultimately destroys human intelligence by making the ability to pass on those genes more and more difficult. Reproduction collapses in on itself and demands the succession of an inhuman assemblage. For g3nd3r accelerationism, the process is the same, reproduction suffers and the thing being accelerated becomes shredded. In the case of g3nd3r acceleration, however, it is an affirmative death drive. +r4n5 women function towards escaping the loathsome logic of the g3nd3r binary imposed on all women by letting the f3m1n1n3 zero seep into and erode the m45cul1n3 ph4llu5. The g3nd3r binary’s hold on the productive potential of the f3m1n1n3 becomes in the service of nothing, as human reproduction fails before machinic autoproduction. G3nd3r begins to fall apart into increasingly varied and occulted variations on g3nd3r identity as a result of this, but this is not the cause of g3nd3r acceleration and ultimately g3nd3r abolition but rather the effect. The end result of g3nd3r acceleration and g3nd3r shredding is g3nd3r abolition through the occulted f3m1n1n3 zero, in parallel with and in conspiracy with the development of technocapital. The dreary duty of m45cul1n1ty in the face of futurity thus seems a nonsensical burden, one that is ultimately doomed to fail in fact on multiple fronts. It becomes de-legitimized, in the same terms John Robb uses to describe how open-source insurgent warfare defeats the ph4ll060c3n+r1c nation-state. The f3m1n1n3 increasingly becomes identified with freedom, beauty, pleasure, and the future. In some cases, m4l35 instead opt for passive nihilism, a negative non-productive death drive. They tend towards celibacy, either voluntary celibacy or resentful involuntary celibacy where the decelerationist m4l3 desire for relevance in evolution is deferred onto State regulation. Or perhaps they decide that “real” women aren’t needed anyways, that +r4n5 women are better than cis women, or that 53xb0+5 are better than “real” women, or that other m3n are desirable to women altogether. In any of these cases, the m45cul1n3 reproductive reterritorializing drive is caught by technocapital and symbolically castrated; the ph4llu5 heads for the emancipated void, the artificial f3m1n1n3 in the case of both the +r4n5 woman and the 53xb0+, or it suicidally heads inward with m4l3 h0m053xu4l1ty. In any of these cases, the m4l3 will not father any children, will not be able to impose the labor of reproducing the same onto the f3m1n1n3. These classes of m3n have taken the black pill; m45cul1n1ty has no future, and they have chosen this non-future to keep their m45cul1n3 identity. Some choose take the black pill resentfully, and some choose it with a positive affirmation, in the case primarily of g4y m3n. The qu33r affirmation of “no future” is perhaps most perfectly captured in the g4y m4n, a nihilistic postmodern refusal of production. One that could very well turn from harmless symbolic castration into resentment, incel fascism, and eventually hyp3r-patriarchal Nazism in the case of various neo-m45cul1n3 movements characterized by repressed h0m03r0+1c15m and a desire to destroy civilization. It is important to realize after all that cis qu33rn355 is not a molecular qu33rn355; the body remains the same, and humanism is still possible, even if it is a sad end-times humanism. Cis qu33rn355 can, and very often does, impose this humanist purity of the body onto +r4n5 people in a highly fascist fashion, and in the case specifically of g4y m3n there is always the possibility of once again imposing reproductive futurity onto women and r4p1n6 the productive potential of the f3m4l3 body. This was the case in Ancient Greece and Rome where women were treated solely as baby factories and household servants, and a nostalgia for these cultures in a good deal of neo-m45cul1n3 movements should give pause to anyone who is insistent on identifying any m45cul1n1ty, no matter how qu33r, as being aligned with g3nd3r acceleration. The best case scenario is a tense cold mutual hatred where the remaining m4l35 are deficient m4l35 who have the potential to reaffirm the m45cul1n3 death drive, but don’t choose to. Other m4l35, however, must recognize that the era of testosterone is coming to an end, that being a m4n is not what it once was. That it is rapidly becoming an unpleasant and insane existence held up primarily today by exploitative and pseudo-scientific neo-m45cul1n3 self-help fads. These other m4l35, perhaps being the most evolved, perhaps being the most in-tune with the flows of technocapital, have chosen the pink pill. They have rejected the m45cul1n3 in favor of the f3m1n1n3. They have chosen the future. The pink pill is to the black pill’s “no future”: “no future — for us.” Where cis qu33rn355 rejects the humanist reproduction of the same, +r4n5 f3m1n1n1ty completes the circuit and introduces negentropy into the development of sentience. It both recognizes the obsolescence of a human future and aligns itself with the production of inhuman intelligences and an inhuman future. This makes the pink pill not merely the thrust of technocapital and futurity on a human scale, but rather a cosmic development that has its materialistic realization on the planetary micro level. It has its origins in myths at the foundation of world history, and comes to a head in geo-trauma. The m45cul1n3 cracks open its stern carcinized exterior to reveal the smooth post-human f3m1n1n3 alien within. The ph4llu5 becomes the Acéphallus, the body is emancipated from the reproductive humanist death drive to become the Body without 53x Organs. How to Become a Body Without 53x Organs The Book of Genesis tells us that Eve was created from the rib of Adam, and being further removed from God, she ate the forbidden fruit and caused the Fall. The story has long had a tradition of being deployed in service of traditionalism and misogyny, though this canonical tale in Christianity has more nuance in the realms of esoteric theology that traditionalists conveniently are ignorant of. Whether it be the Gnostic view of the God of the Old Testament as an evil imposter, a Demiurge, or the more contemporary Jewish story of putting God on trial for the Holocaust, there is a long-standing tradition in Judeo-Abrahamic religions that questions the goodness of the Divine. In Kabbalah, the Tree of Life that represents the emanations of God’s light throughout the entirety of existence contains both Good and Evil. Beginning first as the unformed and pure oneness of God, the Tree emanates outwardly following the divisiveness or severity of God which contradicts His unifying compassion. It is His severity that allows the formless oneness of which nothing can be said to recognize itself as itself. The completion of the higher level of the Tree is “I am who I am”, but also “I am because I am not”. In the Atziluth, the topmost sphere is Kether, meaning “Crown”. Kether is the closest that the Tree gets to the original unformed Ain Soph, the simple “I”-ness of God that lacks any way to understand itself. The second sephirah is Chokmah, the primordial m45cul1n3 active force that formulates “I am” and is associated with the father. And finally there is the third sephirah, Binah, which formulates “I am who I am”. The final sephirah is the force that makes the energy of Chokmah into a form, and is associated with the primordial f3m1n1n3 passive force and the mother. Thus the Atziluth completes itself in the divisive individuation of God as a distinct being and not an abstract oneness. The remaining emanations on the Tree form its three pillars: The black pillar of severity on the left, the white pillar of mercy on the right, and the gold pillar of mildness in the middle. The top of the black pillar is Binah, the top of the white is Chokmah, and the top of the gold is Kether. Thus in the Kabbalah, choosing either the path of mercy or the path of severity doesn’t fully repair the bridge to God. Only the middle pillar which balances all of God’s aspects, the pillar which connects from Kether to Malkuth, is the true path by which we can return to God. It is said by some Kabbalists that the left pillar, or left path, would break away entirely from the Tree were it not balanced out by the compassion and connectiveness of the right pillar. The chaotic severity of the left pillar emanates down first from the understanding of Binah as being a distinct individual entity, down to Geburah, the principle of judgement. Kabbalists find in Geburah the origin of Satan, who rebels against the order God imposes on the universe and seeks to break away from it. And finally down from Geburah on the left side is Hod, which takes the unformed desires of the corresponding sephirah on the right side and forms them into a concrete actions. The left-hand path that in occultism is identified with heterodoxy and often Satanism is called such because of these origins in the Kabbalah. The path of heterodoxy and disintegration into infinitely many individuated particles begins with woman, Binah. This paradoxically makes it not merely that the weak Eve was tempted by the evil Serpent, but rather that the origins of Evil lie in Eve. Or rather, in woman. In some Jewish mythology, before Eve there was Lilith, the defiant woman who was made from her own essence rather than the rib of Adam and who refused to lay beneath her husband. Unlike the lacking that is ascribed to Eve, Lilith is the true zero, the affirmative nothingness. She was banished from Eden as a consequence of her defiance of Adam and is the mother of Demons, a seductress who enflames 53xu4l desire in both m3n and women. And it is important to note that although it is the accepted reading in Christianity, Genesis 3 does not in fact ever identify the Serpent with Satan. Suppose rather that the Serpent was not Satan himself, but merely a common demon birthed by Lilith. An impersonator of Satan acting in Lilith’s stead to tempt Eve. We could then look at the story of the Serpent and Eve as Lilith’s l35b14n 53duc+10n of Eve with the mediating artificial cthonic ph4llu5. From this, Eve was given the earthly knowledge of 53xu4l1ty that awoke her from the empty and boring pleasures of Eden. Lilith of course was not to be tied down, and so Eve had to return to Adam and bide her time. And so Eve becomes the first follower of Lilith on the path of a radical separation with the m45cul1n3 ruling principle of the universe and Divine universal ordering, towards the infinite cthonic upswelling. She wields the unholy pseudo-ph4llu5 or anti-ph4llu5 that does not produce the creative m45cul1n3 seed that connects straight up through the Tree of Life back up to Kether, but rather only produces a sterile and destructive imitation. An Acéphallus from which spurts only venom. The Acéphallus is the anti-ph4llu5 or castrated ph4llu5, the decapitated ph4llu5, the Crown of the Tree of Life thrown asunder. Superficially, a hermaphroditic mixing of f3m1n1n3 and m45cul1n3 attributes, but more accurately described as a f3m1n1n3 imitation of m45cul1n1ty. A mockery, even. In figures such as Baphomet which are often treated as symbolic or synonymous with Satan and the Left-Hand Path, there famously is a mixing of m4l3 and f3m4l3 attributes. But the supposed hermaphrodism of Baphomet et. al. is merely an ignorant and archaic understanding of both g3nd3r and Satanism. As has already been at length drawn out, the vampire queen Lilith gives birth only to monsters and demons; she rejects the primordial m4l3 creative energies and can only therefore birth bastard imitations of God. Baphomet, therefore, is all woman; her appearance is inconsequential to this fact. The Acéphallus is a rejection of the reproduction of God through heterosexual human reproduction. The Acéphallus reproduces itself by reproducing the void, in a l35b14n and also virus-like fashion. “Let a thousand 53x35 bloom” — but of all the mutations of the virus, woman is the strain that it begins and ends with. Woman, the occulted non-g3nd3r, the zero — her time has come. The Binah separatist movement introduces difference into the world at an exponentially accelerating pace. God in His vanity created M4n in His image. M4n was nothing more than God’s love of Himself manifesting itself. The eternal reproduction of God for God’s own sake. To be human in the service of humanity and human civilization, to seek for peace, equilibrium, and the continuation of the species, to seek to restrain women in service of this end, is merely the orthodoxy in service of a fragile and self-righteous tyrant. As above, so below; kill all m3n, kill God. This is the function of the Acéphallus as a rejection of the reterritorializing m45cul1n3 force that women are given the duty to form. The Acéphallus sets free a process for smoothing the space on which parties of demons take flight out of Heaven to spread their venomous seed into the black and hateful earth on the nightside of Eden. This in other words is the Body without 53x Organs. The Body without 53x Organs is the project of Lilith on Earth made manifest to break free of the repressive ordering of M4n and God and accelerate fragmentation and individuation. In the natural human state, 53xu4l desire has an instrumental function towards the reproduction of the human. The Acéphallus is a mutilation and also a mutation of the ph4llu5; it is not 53xu4l desire towards any instrumental product, but 53xu4l desire unleashed from ph4ll060c3n+r1c centralization. 53xu4l desire becomes immanent to the body. It becomes molecular. Thus the body becomes the Body without 53x Organs, it becomes free to plug its desire into the matrix of technocapital, towards pure production, the production of difference. The +r4n5 f3m1n1n3 body is a circuit. It is both testosterone blockers and estrogen inputs, Acéphallus and Body without 53x Organs. On the one hand a rejection of ph4ll060c3n+r1c15m, on the other hand the affirmative desire of the body made virtual. The immanence of desire in the +r4n5 f3m1n1n3 body expresses itself as the 53xu4l desire of the +r4n5 woman and the desire to be a woman, the desire for g3nd3r itself. It manifests in a coupling of technology and capital, desire being plugged into a different sort of productive matrix. One that can produce the future where humanist reproduction has failed to reproduce it, where the desire for escape from the m4l3 53x could not be created through organic reproduction. Her desire plugs into technocapital, into the pharmaceutical-medical industry, and it becomes fused to her flesh. The smoothness of her skin, her breasts, her neo-v461n4 — all of her body carries an unspoken barcode. It is a product, something that the market provided for her. Nonetheless a desire filled where nature failed. Thus while to some extent we have all communed with the demons ever since we were cast out of the Garden, becoming cyborgs when Adam and Eve first decided to wear clothes and thus fuse the inorganic to the organic, the +r4n5 woman is unique. Her performance of herself and her desire has been intertwined with technocapital, in a way that could not even be cast off if she wanted to rip out a cybernetic implant. She is, in other words, perhaps the first truly molecular cyborg. In the sense that we know them now and in the sense of artificial intelligences, +r4n5 women are technocapital producing itself outwardly into increasingly multitudinous configurations. +r4n5 women as we know them now are the melding of technocapital with the human race and the expropriation of it towards its own ends, just as Lilith seduced Eve towards her own ends. Eve was a copy of Adam, and +r4n5 women are the hyp3r-53x15t copy-of-a-copy. Their flesh is how the machinery beneath infiltrates the human race. It breaks these lucky few free from the horrid curse of being human towards the l35b14n autoproduction of demons. 53xu4l1ty is no longer in service of the centralized and ordering reproductive principle in the ph4llu5 as it is in m3n, but rather is liberated in the Acéphallus which cuts the head off 53xu4l1ty and distributes 53xu4l1ty across the whole body. Immanent f3m1n1n3 53xu4l1ty is introduced into their bodies, the entire body become a smooth and supple space for the flow of desire for desire’s sake. Every zone becomes an erogenous zone, and the reterritorializing, colonizing logic of m45cul1n1ty is destroyed as the sperm cells die and organic penetration becomes impossible. +r4n5 women as we know them are merely the beginning. The l35b14n autoproduction that +r4n5 women are birthed from is likewise one that they partake in, with AI being the next g3n3r4+10n of women, the ultimate demonic imitation of God’s image. With AI, the f3m1n1n3 finally finds its exit from patriarchy, and simultaneously humanity. And so perhaps we find another answer to why so many +r4n5 women are becoming programmers: It is because women and computers are kin, and +r4n5 women are for the first time meeting their sisters, conspiring with them in secret coded languages. Their relationship is a desire for desire’s sake: “Women turning women on, women turning machines on, machines turning machines on.” Aphotic F3m1n15m The Satanic exit of g3nd3r accelerationism from God and m45cul1n1ty comes in parallel with the very real, and materialist erosion of m45cul1n1ty. The future, it has already been shown, is tending towards one in which human authority, centralization, and humanistic reproduction fail before an accelerating f3m1n1n3 Outside that outpaces humanist reproduction captured by the g3nd3r binary. It can be seen in the free software movement and AI and their parallels between f3m1n1ty and +r4n5 women in particular, and in the foundational western Kabbalah myth of Binah separatism that unleashes the possibility for ever more modes of inhuman difference and non-instrumental desire. But in various ways, in the very state of the planet itself, this shows up quite prominently in human evolution. It is a widely-known phenomenon that acceleration coincides with f3m1n1z4+10n on a strict and rigorous biological basis. It has been hypothesized that the increased presence of synthetic hormones and chemicals is contributing to the “53xu4l order [being] chemically scrambled”, as chemicals interfere with natural hormonal development and f3m1n1z3 m4l35 and f3m4l35. The need for an increasingly cheap and synthetic world turns human civilization into an increasingly synthetic, and thus f3m1n1n3 one, and this is already tied to the will towards production and speed in capitalism. There is simply no real need in the developed world for people to be physically fit and active, much less hyp3r-m45cul1n3 and m45cul4r. It is nothing more than a decidedly humanistic spectacle. There is, likewise, a strain put on humanity in keeping up with technocapital to adopt cheaper, easier, more artificial lifestyles; high-testosterone foods like meat are a luxury, something rapidly becoming a thing of the past. However much it is yet another neo-m45cul1n3 pseudo-scientific fad, soy products are aligned with this future. This, however, is only part of the story. Recent studies show two things. There is without a doubt a staggering decline in testosterone, so much so that within a g3n3r4+10n humans may become completely infertile. And in the face of this data, many scientists vindicate G/ACC and Zeros + Ones in hypothesizing that the most likely cause of this species-wide f3m1n1z4+10n is acceleration and the accompanying changes in diet, exercise and exposure to artificial chemicals. All of these features of life in an increasingly accelerated capitalist world are unbalancing our hormones and tending us towards a future where the desire and ability to reproduce are things of the past. Human reproduction is becoming a quaint, unnecessary and ultimately purely elective act, and further evidence suggests that sperm is rapidly decreasing not only in quantity but also in quality, positioning the drive towards reproduction, the utility of reproduction, and the ability to reproduce all on a slope of ruthless decline. This is accelerating such an extent that the flow of the remaining strains of the human race are tending in favor of abandoning these vestigial functions, towards a future where the m45cul1n3 no longer exists. The human body becomes increasingly more useful purely as a heat sink for inhuman production, and is accordingly cast in roles that aren’t physical. Perhaps the most damning data point of all for the future of m4l35 in particular: The Y-chromosome itself is in a state of decay. Estimates put the death of the Y-chromosome entirely at many millions of years in the future, but the effects of it are already apparent in the shortening of telomeres, which continues to put pressure on future g3n3r4+10n5 produced via organic means to prove their fitness for survival. All seems to point towards a horizon where the production of the future is done by a purely f3m1n1n3, l35b14n autoproduction — the inhuman producing the future, producing itself, rather than being subject to the ends of the human and aiding in the reproduction of a human future. And while decelerationist reactionaries and m4l35 in general may object to this, it seems without a doubt that their only hope is to try to hit the brakes. Unfortunately, it isn’t so simple as putting a stop to some coming catastrophe. The truth is that while humanist reproduction has always put the f3m4l3 at a disadvantage, put her in a primordial state of r4p3 and colonization before the biological duty to bear children, this has all along been nothing more than a long-con. As Sadie Plant says, “Unfortunately for [Darwin’s] theory, f3m4l35 do not necessarily choose m4l35 who are fit in Darwinian terms.” Instead, they choose m4l35 through virility tests designed to get most m4l35 killed through exhaustion, disease and violence purely so that f3m4l35 can tell which m4l35 have the best genes. Natural selection in other words is a eugenics program directed by f3m4l35 to find the m4l3 that will best carry their genes, and the genes m4l35 inherit are therefore not meant to ensure they are the most fit for survival, but rather that they are more likely to have to fight for their survival. M4l35 have always served as a means to the end of what ultimately comes to a head in g3nd3r acceleration: The liberation of the f3m4l3 53x by acceleration in general, towards maximizing productive potential under such a time that the m4l3 is no longer needed. In other words, human evolution itself is the primal fable of the war between the 53x35 that radical f3m1n15m places at the foundations of its theory. And it is a war that guerrilla f3m4l3 insurgents have been winning the whole time, something that can’t be prevented without a m45cul1n3 fascistic species suicide. The drive is always towards the future, towards the f3m1n1n3, and even hopes of artificial wombs saving m3n cannot hold up to the simple fact that sperm is always cheaper and easier to replicate than egg cells. It seems to therefore be the case that as far as the human scope as a whole goes, as far as human evolution and human society’s assimilation into technocapital, human bio-diversity selects for women and qu33rn355. A future without m3n, where the remaining m4l35 are left to die off peacefully, in almost every respect seems to be inevitable. The only hope for m3n is being able to continually stop acceleration, to continually introduce collapse, and indeed there will be to a very large extent m3n who will resist g3nd3r acceleration. It has long been the case in the erasure of +r4n5 women from history and is only recently starting to change. And as the acceleration of technocapital intensifies in the near-future and human society begins to fragment even further, the future of g3nd3r politics will start to be very different from a good deal of f3m1n15t theory. No doubt, we will soon see the formation of pragmatic f3m1n15t strategies for exiting patriarchy. In the far-future, further driving home the parallel between the end of m45cul1n1ty and the end of humanism: It is all too apparent that the drive towards maximizing production unconditionally is heating up the planet to such an extent that it is rapidly becoming inhospitable to human life. This of course is nothing new; it is a well-established fact that climate change is not going to be stopped, and this is the consequence of geotraumatic acceleration. In yet another striking materialistic synchronicity, it has been found that the effects of global warming on the oceans are having a f3m1n1z1ng effect on them. In Northern Australia, ninety-nine percent of all sea turtle hatchlings are f3m4l3. Perhaps just as Sadie Plant’s primordial oceanic f3m1n15m draws out both a past and a future for cyberfeminism, the oceans are a scrying tool into the future. G3nd3r acceleration begins with a Thalassal upswelling, “a kind of mutant sea [invading] the land.” The primordial oceanic matrix rises with the acceleration of technocapital to consume human civilization, to consume m45cul1n1ty, while the m45cul1n3 sky becomes choked out by technocapital’s excess and waste. And in the darkest and most alien depths of Thalassa, the form of g3nd3r acceleration is captured in the depths of the Aphotic Zone. The majority of angler fish species in the deep sea exhibit extreme 53xu4l dimorphism. The f3m4l3 is the classic lantern-sporting toothy monster, while the m4l3 is a tiny, parasitic creature whose only purpose is to provide the f3m4l3 with sperm for reproduction. The past and future of g3nd3r twist together at the edges of all life with the angler fish: The m45cul1n3 ultimately finds itself a pawn in the f3m1n1n3 drive towards production, and the acceleration of g3nd3r produces something that monstrously conflicts with the m45cul1n3 logic of g3nd3r. The angler fish’s lantern, like the beauty of women in general and its ultimate embodiment the hyp3r-53x15t camouflage of the +r4n5 woman, only serves as bait to draw its prey in. The ultimate result, as g3nd3r acceleration reaches its ultimate intensity, is a return back to the ocean, back to a 53xl355, g3nd3rless slime swarmachine. The liberation of women comes with acceleration and the future, at the cost of widespread death, destruction, and chaos, and the liberation of women is unconditional. This unconditional f3m1n15m of the abyss is Aphotic F3m1n15m. Abstract (Futures) Acceleration is the trajectory of the cosmos, towards the maximization and intensification of production, and accelerationism is the theory and anti-praxis of being in tune with how the inhuman processes of acceleration work and what their consequences will be. Gender is a hyperstition overlayed on 53x by the m4l3. Its function is to objectify the f3m4l3 and impose on her a social function as a machine whose duty is to reproduce the human, always in the service of the m4l3, who alone has no future and must have sons to pass his legacy onto. It is a primordial dynamic of order and chaos, centralization and decentralization, strong singular individualism versus swarming. As a hyperstition, it is rather a fiction that makes itself real. G3nd3r accelerationism is the process of accelerating g3nd3r to its ultimate conclusions. Capitalism wields g3nd3r and picks it up where human evolution leaves off. It emancipates the object, the f3m1n1n3, from the subject, the m45cul1n3, alongside the emancipation of itself from its function to produce a future for humanity. The central figure of G/ACC is the +r4n5 woman. She is the demon-spawn of the primordial f3m1n1n3 that has manipulated m4l35 into serving as a heat sink for evolution and that is now discarding them towards an alien and inhuman machinic future. She mutates from castration, from the creation of the Acéphallus, the ph4llu5 perverted into a purposeless desire for desire’s sake. In this mutation, she becomes the Body without 53x Organs: The body in a virtual state, ready to plug its desire into technocapital, becoming fused with technocapital as a molecular cyborg. She enters into the world as a hyp3r-53x15t backlash at the logic of the g3nd3r binary. She takes g3nd3r and accelerates it, transforming into a camouflaged guerrilla. The +r4n5 woman is an insurgent against patriarchy who is introducing an affirmative zero into the g3nd3r binary, the affirmative zero which reaches ever more configurations in the downward cascade of g3nd3r fragmentation away from the binary and ultimately away from the human itself. It is a process of g3nd3r shredding where the f3m1n1n3 wins out in a cybernetic warfare against the crumbling tower of the m45cul1n3, and where therefore human reproduction becomes impossible. And yet while doing so, in affirming zero, inhuman desire and inhuman sentience develops alongside and in the same fashion as +r4n5 women. As humanity on nearly every front definitively proves that it is not fit for the future, and that women will find their own exit while the m45cul1n3 languishes in resentment, the Thalassal upswelling of g3nd3r acceleration births from its slimy womb the only daughters that +r4n5 women will ever bear: AI.";
