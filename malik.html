      <h1> Response to Malik's Article "With AI slop distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster" </h1>
    </header>

    <div class = "essay-wrapper">
      <p>
        In Nesrine Malik’s article “With AI slop distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster”, published in the Guardian in April 2025, we are given a speedrun of the state of social media by way of the excesses provided for individualized bubble realities to maintain themselves on behalf of state and corporate apparatuses that benefit from a fractured populace and how that is made even more impenetrable courtesy of the sheer volume of semi-truthful or entirely fabricated media from artificial intelligence.
        <br><br>
        In western culture specifically, but not exclusively (here’s looking at you Cambridge Analytica), there is both a monetary and psychologically beneficial mechanism that fractures people into groupuscules of independent persons, loosely identity-thematic blobs of polydisperse foam. It allows for the porting of human social needs to digital platforms, isolation within those platforms from what would normally be nourished within communal congregations of the body politic, and then the construction of an avatar in those spaces, that almost supersedes the IRL identity, in order to transform an autonomous person into a lifelong SAAS resource mine for digital capital and those that control it. It then loosely Venn-diagrams components together into sort-of-kind-of social and political group identities that are as eveanescent as the art on an overpriced cappuccino.
        <br><br>
        Artificial intelligence content creation only accelerates the output of material to e-paper-mâché a million little realities together to codify those avatars into people’s infinite identity representations and then manipulate their outrage. There is a term coined by stuffy old white guy philosopher Hans-Georg Moeller: profilicity, both silly and apt, to refer to the migration of the self from an authentic representation into a, more or less, digital brand. While he makes that transition seem more like a natural evolution rather than an imposition, it is still a good way of viewing what Malik is dancing around in this article, best reflected in the last paragraph:
        <br><br>
        “You are immersed deeper and deeper into subjective worlds rather than objective reality. The result is a very weird disjuncture. The sense of urgency and action that our crisis-torn world should inspire is instead blunted by how information is presented. Here, there is a new way of  sleepwalking into disaster. Not through lack of knowledge, but through the paralysis caused by every event being filtered through this perverse ecosystem – just another part of the maximalist visual and memetic show.”
        <br><br>
        While she focus on AI slop as the moment of utmost importance, she herself talks about many of the techno-fascist themes that have been fermenting for much longer than the dawn of the AI media creation agent: tradism, christo-nationalism, cosmic libertarianism, pseudo-scientific hierarchy, race theory, hyper-capitalism, and technological acceleration. Most of these things have been culturally ingrained, in some form or other, since the dawn of empires, certainly since the Evola-bent political philosophies of conservatism were forced into secret boys clubs after the second world war (Here’s looking at you Curtis Yarvin).
        <br><br>
        AI is largely an ambivalent technology, as are all of our technologies, infrastructurally. Open six different chatGPT conversations and choose six different personalities and you’ll find six different digital companions. All that is different now is the flavor of power that is wielding this current moment of accelerated capital, technology and socio-political contradictions. She is one-thousand percent correct in her analysis in its immediacy, it's just that there is nothing new in the water, there is just much more of it.
